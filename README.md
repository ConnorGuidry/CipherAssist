# CipherAssist (Working Title)

This is a plaintext cryptography application with multiple encryption standards of varying levels of security. With this application, multiple users can securely access, store, and generate cryptographic keys based on their desired method of encryption. Using said keys, users can encrypt and decrypt plaintext. 

Its user interface is a simple, no-frills GUI that is easily navigable without having to reference any documentation. (OPTIONAL ITEMS: The application can also encrypt and decrypt plaintext files, rather than just the user's direct input.)

(OPTIONAL 2.0 VERSION: Program can encrypt and decrypt any type of file, not just plaintext. It can also be run as a command-line application for ease of use when large batch processing.)
