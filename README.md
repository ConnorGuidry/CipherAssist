# CipherAssist

This is a plaintext cryptography application with multiple encryption standards of varying levels of security. With this application, multiple users can securely access, store, and generate cryptographic keys based on their desired method of encryption. Using said keys, users can encrypt and decrypt plaintext. Its user interface is a simple, no-frills GUI that is easily navigable without having to reference any documentation. 

Program uses custom Java implementation of SHA-256 hashing for password storage.

## Versioning
1.0 - Initial release.

1.1 - Upgrade to encrypt and decrypt text files rather than just plaintext input.

2.0 - Upgrade to encrypt and decrypt any type of file. Add command-line functionality for advanced usage, large batch processing. Add file hash generator/hash validator function.

## Installation
{WIP}

## Usage
{WIP}

## Contributing
Push feature branches (formatted feature-\*), merge into development branch. Releases will have their own branches after each initial release, where features and/or fixes can be merged in during deployment. Development branch is always a release ahead of the most recent feature branch. Final releases will be merged into master, with any later work being done on their corresponding release branch.
