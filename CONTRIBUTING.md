Push feature branches (formatted feature-*), merge into development branch. Releases will have their own branches after each initial release, where features and/or fixes can be merged in during deployment. Development branch is always a release ahead of the most recent feature branch. Final releases will be merged into master, with any later work being done on their corresponding release branch.
